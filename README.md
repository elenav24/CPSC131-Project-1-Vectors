# Project 1 Vectors
- My submission for Computer Science 131-06, Section 06, Lab Week 5
- Objective: To implement a custom vector class named MyVector. The MyVector class will have much of the functionality of the familiar std::vector class, including the ability to dynamically resize.
- Disclaimer: This is a project for my CPSC 131 Data Structures Class, created by Professor Peralta at CSUF
